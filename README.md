# leave-room-for-thoughts
An institution for creative exploration :) 

## Install
`git clone https://github.com/tealprocess/leave-room-for-thoughts.git`
`cd leave-room-for-thoughts`
`npx picosite -o .`
`npx @picosite/serve --local -i .`

Open your browser to 127.0.0.1:4000 (or click on the link in your terminal) to view your site.

## Tools
So far, using:

- https://github.com/estrattonbailey/picosite for site publishing
- custom grid system with sass

---
Need to think about:

- components? do we need a system?
